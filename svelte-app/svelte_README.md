Attribute clustering was implemented in a final analysis of the three variables identified as important factors in the ongoing opioid epidemic (overdose deaths per 100,000 people [2010-2020], opioid pills prescribed per 100 people [2012], and MAT providers [2022]). The three variables were run through a KMeans algorithm to create 5 clusters and determine levels of risk status in counties. Below are the results:

In analyzing the above results, determinations on the risk status of counties with sufficient data were made based on rates of pills prescribed, rates of overdose deaths, and rates of MAT providers.

As expected, counties are noted as the most vulnerable in the region of Appalachia, among other low-income counties. There are 4 counties that were clustered and classified as the least vulnerable due to a sufficient number of average MAT providers, lower pill distribution rate, and moderate overdose death rate. Lastly, counties that were earlier highlighted due to lack of data were also clustered and risk status is determined to be unavailable as a result.
